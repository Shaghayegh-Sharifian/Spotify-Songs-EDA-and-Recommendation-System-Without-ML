# Introduction and Project Aims
It is not necessary to always use **Machine Learning** algorithms, sometimes we can easily create an application using different concepts and libraries.<br>
In this code, I built a Spotify Recommender System using neither sci-kit-learn nor machine-learning algorithms.<br>
This recommender system asks the user for a songâ€™s name (to recommend songs in the same genre) and a number (to know the number of songs to recommend).<br>
<br>
This project was a part of my Data Scientist Course.
