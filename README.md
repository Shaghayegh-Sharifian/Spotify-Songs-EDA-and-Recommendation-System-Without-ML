# Spotify-Songs-EDA-and-recommendation-System-Without-ML
    It is not necessary to always use Machine Learning algorithms, sometimes we can easily create an application using different concepts and libraries.
    In this code, I built a Spotify Recommender System using neither sci-kit-learn nor machine-learning algorithms.
    This recommender system asks the user for a songâ€™s name (to recommend songs in the same genre) and a number (to know the number of songs to recommend).
